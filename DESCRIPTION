Title: Orthorectification of UAV collected Hyperspectral Data
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Jane Cowles
Maintainer: Jane Cowles <jcowles@umn.edu>
Description: This package contains functions to convert extensionless bil files created by hyperspectral sensors on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, drone) or airplane with imu/gps device to orthorectified usable imagery for analysis. Hyperspectral data differs from many other aerial imagery types in that it is collected in a "push broom" style, leading to data that is a set of linear arranged pixels, rather than a 2d datafile. These lines of pixels need to be arranged according to the orientation of the aircraft. This package does that, avoiding point-and-click software to allow replicability and transparency.
