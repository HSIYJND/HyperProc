This package allows quick and easy code based processing of hyperspectral imagery collected by a UAV (drone) or other aircraft. If you're looking at this vignette, I likely don't have to tell you this, but with point-and-click proprietary software, if one thing is off you have to go click through all the steps again to fix anything, and you have no good record of what you did. This package is the first in R to solve this issue.
